# Path-Selection
Classification Model (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree)

In this project, we are trying to building several classification models to learn the optimal strategy for selecting the right path (i.e. path with lowest cost)
After learning an optimal strategy, when we see new costs, instead of solving an optimization problem, we can use the developed strategy to select the path. 

This is part of coursework for NUS MSBA DBA5106 2020.
